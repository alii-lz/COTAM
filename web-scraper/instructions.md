you need to have mongoose installed in this directory with `npm install mongoose`

run `grabber.sh` and it should fill the database, you can delete the extra files after.

`course_unpacker.js` is the script that connects to mongodb so maybe check that first
to see if there are errors.

You need to have `curl` and `read` available on your system but they should be by default.
